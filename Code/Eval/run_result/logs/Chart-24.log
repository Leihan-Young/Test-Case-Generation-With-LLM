# Bug Explanation:
The bug is in the `getPaint()` method of the `GrayPaintScale` class. The method calculates the shade of gray based on the value passed as a parameter, but it uses the original value instead of the adjusted value `v` in the calculation. The correct code should be:
```
int g = (int) ((v - this.lowerBound) / (this.upperBound 
            - this.lowerBound) * 255.0);
```
This bug causes incorrect shades of gray to be returned for values outside the scale range. For example, if the `lowerBound` is 0 and the `upperBound` is 100, a value of -10 should result in black, but the bug causes it to return white instead. Similarly, a value of 110 should result in white, but the bug causes it to return black instead.

# Bug Explanation:
The bug is in the `getPaint()` method of the `GrayPaintScale` class. The method calculates the shade of gray based on the value passed as a parameter, but it uses the original value instead of the adjusted value `v` in the calculation. The correct code should be:
```
int g = (int) ((v - this.lowerBound) / (this.upperBound 
            - this.lowerBound) * 255.0);
```
This bug causes incorrect shades of gray to be returned for values outside the scale range. For example, if the `lowerBound` is 0 and the `upperBound` is 100, a value of -10 should result in black, but the bug causes it to return white instead. Similarly, a value of 110 should result in white, but the bug causes it to return black instead.
