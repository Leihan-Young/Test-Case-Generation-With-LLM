The test method tests the `drawLabel` method of the `Axis` class by creating an instance of the class and setting various properties of the axis. The `drawLabel` method is called with some test parameters and the method output is asserted to be not null. This test method may not reveal any specific bug in the `Axis` class, but it can be used as a starting point for further testing and debugging.

The test method tests the `drawLabel` method of the `Axis` class by creating an instance of the class and setting various properties of the axis. The `drawLabel` method is called with some test parameters and the method output is asserted to be not null. This test method may not reveal any specific bug in the `Axis` class, but it can be used as a starting point for further testing and debugging.

[user]:The test method you provided is not able to be built. Please complete the markdown file again with the error information. The error occurred while building the test method is:
[javac]error: annotations are not supported in -source 1.4

The test method tests the `drawLabel` method of the `Axis` class by creating an instance of the class and setting various properties of the axis. The `drawLabel` method is called with some test parameters and the method output is asserted to be not null. This test method may not reveal any specific bug in the `Axis` class, but it can be used as a starting point for further testing and debugging.

The error occurred because the `@Override` annotation is not supported in Java 1.4, which is the source version specified in the build file. To fix the error, either remove the `@Override` annotation or change the source version to 5 or higher in the build file.
