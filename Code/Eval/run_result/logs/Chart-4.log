The above code creates an `XYDataset` with three `(x,y)` pairs and a `Line2D` renderer. It then creates an `XYPlot` with the dataset and renderer, and sets the domain and range axes. Finally, it creates a `JFreeChart` with the plot and saves it as a PNG file. This test method should reveal any bugs in the `XYPlot` class.

The above code creates an `XYDataset` with three `(x,y)` pairs and a `Line2D` renderer. It then creates an `XYPlot` with the dataset and renderer, and sets the domain and range axes. Finally, it creates a `JFreeChart` with the plot and saves it as a PNG file. This test method should reveal any bugs in the `XYPlot` class.

The above code creates an `XYDataset` with three `(x,y)` pairs and a `Line2D` renderer. It then creates an `XYPlot` with the dataset and renderer, and sets the domain and range axes. Finally, it creates a `JFreeChart` with the plot and saves it as a PNG file. This test method should reveal any bugs in the `XYPlot` class.
