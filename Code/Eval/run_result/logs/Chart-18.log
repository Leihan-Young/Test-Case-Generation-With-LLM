The bug in the program is in the `DefaultKeyedValues` class's `removeValue(int index)` method. When removing an item from the `keys` and `values` ArrayLists, the `rebuildIndex()` method should be called only if the `index` is less than the size of the `keys` ArrayList. So the correct implementation of the `removeValue(int index)` method should be:
```
public void removeValue(int index) {
    this.keys.remove(index);
    this.values.remove(index);
    if (index < this.keys.size()) {
        rebuildIndex();
    }
}

```
The bug in the program is in the `DefaultKeyedValues` class's `removeValue(int index)` method. When removing an item from the `keys` and `values` ArrayLists, the `rebuildIndex()` method should be called only if the `index` is less than the size of the `keys` ArrayList. So the correct implementation of the `removeValue(int index)` method should be:
```
public void removeValue(int index) {
    this.keys.remove(index);
    this.values.remove(index);
    if (index < this.keys.size()) {
        rebuildIndex();
    }
}
```

```
The bug in the program is in the `DefaultKeyedValues` class's `removeValue(int index)` method. When removing an item from the `keys` and `values` ArrayLists, the `rebuildIndex()` method should be called only if the `index` is less than the size of the `keys` ArrayList. So the correct implementation of the `removeValue(int index)` method should be:
```
public void removeValue(int index) {
    this.keys.remove(index);
    this.values.remove(index);
    if (index < this.keys.size()) {
        rebuildIndex();
    }
}
```

```
The error message indicates that the `DefaultKeyedValues` class could not be found. This may be because the necessary import statement is missing at the beginning of the test class, or because the class is not in the classpath. To fix this issue, make sure the necessary import statement is present and that the class is in the classpath. For example, if `DefaultKeyedValues` is in the `org.jfree.data` package, add the following import statement at the beginning of the test class:
```
import org.jfree.data.DefaultKeyedValues;
```
