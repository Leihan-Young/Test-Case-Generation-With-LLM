GetYear() {
    Week week = new Week(2021, 1); // create a week for year 2021, week 1
    Year year = week.getYear(); // get the year of the week
    assertEquals(2021, year.getYear()); // assert that the year returned is 2021
}
```

The bug in this program is that the `firstMillisecond` and `lastMillisecond` fields in the `Week` class are not being initialized properly. This can cause issues when trying to calculate the date range of a week.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `Week` constructor to initialize these fields. We can do this using the `Calendar` class to determine the first and last millisecond of the week.

Here's the updated `Week` class with the bug fix:
```
public class Week extends RegularTimePeriod implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1856387786939865061L;
    public static final int FIRST_WEEK_IN_YEAR = 1;
    public static final int LAST_WEEK_IN_YEAR = 53;
    private short year;
    private byte week;
    private long firstMillisecond;
    private long lastMillisecond;
    /**
     * Creates a new week.
     *
     * @param year  the year.
     * @param week  the week number (1 to 53).
     */
    public Week(int year, int week) {
        if (week < FIRST_WEEK_IN_YEAR || week > LAST_WEEK_IN_YEAR) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid week.");
        }
        this.year = (short) year;
        this.week = (byte) week;

        Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance(Locale.getDefault());
        calendar.clear();
        calendar.set(Calendar.YEAR, year);
        calendar.set(Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR, week);

        this.firstMillisecond = calendar.getTimeInMillis();
        calendar.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR, 6);
        this.lastMillisecond = calendar.getTimeInMillis();
    }
    /**
     * Returns the year in which the week falls.
     *
     * @return The year (never <code>null</code>).
     */
    public Year getYear() {
        return new Year(this.year);
    }
}
```

With this bug fix in place, the `testGetYear()` method should now pass successfully.
