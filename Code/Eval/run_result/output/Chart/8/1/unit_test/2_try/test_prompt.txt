# Test Code:
A test method that can reveal the bug of the java program.
```
public void test
[assistant]:GetYear() {
    Week week = new Week(2021, 1); // create a week for year 2021, week 1
    Year year = week.getYear(); // get the year of the week
    assertEquals(2021, year.getYear()); // assert that the year returned is 2021
}
```
The bug in this program is that the `Week` class does not have a constructor that takes in parameters for the week number. Therefore, the instantiation of `Week` in the test method is incorrect and will result in an error. To fix this bug, a constructor that takes in both the year and week number should be added to the `Week` class.
[user]:The test method you provided fails to find the bug in the java program. Please complete the markdown file again.
