GetYear() {
    Week week = new Week(2021, 1); // create a week for year 2021, week 1
    Year year = week.getYear(); // get the year of the week
    assertEquals(2021, year.getYear()); // assert that the year returned is 2021
}
```

I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. The test method provided is correct and will not reveal the bug in the `Week` class.

The bug in this program is that the `getFirstMillisecond()` and `getLastMillisecond()` methods in the `Week` class are not implemented correctly. These methods are used to calculate the start and end dates of a week, but they currently return incorrect values.

To fix this bug, we need to update these methods to correctly calculate the start and end dates of a week based on the year and week number.

Here's the updated `Week` class with the bug fix:
```
public class Week extends RegularTimePeriod implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1856387786939865061L;
    public static final int FIRST_WEEK_IN_YEAR = 1;
    public static final int LAST_WEEK_IN_YEAR = 53;
    private short year;
    private byte week;
    private long firstMillisecond;
    private long lastMillisecond;
    /**
     * Creates a new week.
     *
     * @param year  the year.
     * @param week  the week number (1 to 53).
     */
    public Week(int year, int week) {
        if (week < FIRST_WEEK_IN_YEAR || week > LAST_WEEK_IN_YEAR) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid week.");
        }
        this.year = (short) year;
        this.week = (byte) week;

        Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance(Locale.getDefault());
        calendar.clear();
        calendar.set(Calendar.YEAR, year);
        calendar.set(Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR, week);
        calendar.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK, Calendar.SUNDAY);

        this.firstMillisecond = calendar.getTimeInMillis();
        calendar.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR, 6);
        this.lastMillisecond = calendar.getTimeInMillis();
    }
    /**
     * Returns the year in which the week falls.
     *
     * @return The year (never <code>null</code>).
     */
    public Year getYear() {
        return new Year(this.year);
    }
    /**
     * Returns the first millisecond of the week.
     *
     * @param calendar  the calendar.
     *
     * @return The first millisecond of the week.
     */
    public long getFirstMillisecond(Calendar calendar) {
        calendar.clear();
        calendar.set(Calendar.YEAR, this.year);
        calendar.set(Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR, this.week);
        calendar.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK, Calendar.SUNDAY);
        return calendar.getTimeInMillis();
    }
    /**
     * Returns the last millisecond of the week.
     *
     * @param calendar  the calendar.
     *
     * @return The last millisecond of the week.
     */
    public long getLastMillisecond(Calendar calendar) {
        calendar.clear();
        calendar.set(Calendar.YEAR, this.year);
        calendar.set(Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR, this.week);
        calendar.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK, Calendar.SATURDAY);
        return calendar.getTimeInMillis() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 - 1;
    }
}
```

With this bug fix in place, the `testGetYear()` method should pass successfully and the start and end dates of a week should be calculated correctly.
