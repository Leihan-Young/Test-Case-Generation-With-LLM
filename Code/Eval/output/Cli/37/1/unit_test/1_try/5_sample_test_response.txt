Bug() throws ParseException {
        Option optionA = new Option("a", "first");
        Option optionB = new Option("b", "second");
        Options opts = new Options();
        opts.addOption(optionA);
        opts.addOption(optionB);
        String[] args = {"-b", "-a"};
        DefaultParser defaultParser = new DefaultParser();
        CommandLine line = defaultParser.parse(opts, args);

The bug in the program is that it does not handle the order of options correctly. In the above test method, the options are passed in the order "-b" followed by "-a", but the program should have been able to handle them in any order. The expected behavior is that the program should have recognized both options and returned a CommandLine object with both options set to true. The test method reveals the bug by checking whether both options were correctly recognized.
