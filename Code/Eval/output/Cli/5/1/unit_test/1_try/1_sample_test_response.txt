StripLeadingAndTrailingQuotes() {
        String str = "\"quoted string\"";
        String result = Util.stripLeadingAndTrailingQuotes(str);
        assertEquals("quoted string", result);
    }
```
The above test method will test if the `stripLeadingAndTrailingQuotes()` method is working as expected. If the method is not implemented correctly, the test will fail and reveal the bug.
