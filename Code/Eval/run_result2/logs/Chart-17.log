 * Changes
 * -------
 * 11-Oct-2001 : Version 1 (DG);
 * 14-Nov-2001 : Added listener mechanism (DG);
 * 15-Nov-2001 : Updated argument checking and exceptions in add() method (DG);
 * 29-Nov-2001 : Added properties to describe the domain and range (DG);
 * 07-Dec-2001 : Renamed TimeSeries --> BasicTimeSeries (DG);
 * 01-Mar-2002 : Updated import statements (DG);
 * 28-Mar-2002 : Added a method add(TimePeriod, double) (DG);
 * 27-Aug-2002 : Changed return type of delete method to void (DG);
 * 04-Oct-2002 : Added itemCount and historyCount attributes, fixed errors 
 *               reported by Checkstyle (DG);

 * Changes
 * -------
 * 11-Oct-2001 : Version 1 (DG);
 * 14-Nov-2001 : Added listener mechanism (DG);
 * 15-Nov-2001 : Updated argument checking and exceptions in add() method (DG);
 * 29-Nov-2001 : Added properties to describe the domain and range (DG);
 * 07-Dec-2001 : Renamed TimeSeries --> BasicTimeSeries (DG);
 * 01-Mar-2002 : Updated import statements (DG);
 * 28-Mar-2002 : Added a method add(TimePeriod, double) (DG);
 * 27-Aug-2002 : Changed return type of delete method to void (DG);
 * 04-Oct-2002 : Added itemCount and historyCount attributes, fixed errors 
 *               reported by Checkstyle (DG);
 * 29-Oct-2002 : Added series change notification to addOrUpdate() method (DG);
 * 28-Jan-2003 : Changed name back to TimeSeries (DG);
 * 13-Mar-2003 : Moved to com.jrefinery.data.time package and implemented 
 *               Serializable (DG);
 * 01-May-2003 : Updated equals() method (see bug report 727575) (DG);
 * 14-Aug-2003 : Added ageHistoryCountItems method (copied existing code for 
 *               contents) made a method and added to addOrUpdate.  Made a 
 *               public method to enable ageing against a specified time 
 *               (eg now) as opposed to lastest time in series (BS);
 * 15-Oct-2003 : Added fix for setItemCount method - see bug report 804425.  
 *               Modified exception message in add() method to be more 
 *               informative (DG);
 * 13-Apr-2004 : Added clear() method (DG);
 * 21-May-2004 : Added an extra addOrUpdate() method (DG);
 * 15-Jun-2004 : Fixed NullPointerException in equals() method (DG);
 * 29-Nov-2004 : Fixed bug 1075255 (DG);
 * 17-Nov-2005 : Renamed historyCount --> maximumItemAge (DG);
 * 28-Nov-2005 : Changed maximumItemAge from int to long (DG);
 * 01-Dec-2005 : New add methods accept notify flag (DG);
 * ------------- JFREECHART 1.0.x ---------------------------------------------
 * 24-May-2006 : Improved error handling in createCopy() methods (DG);
 * 01-Sep-2006 : Fixed bugs in removeAgedItems() methods - see bug report 
 *               1550045 (DG);
 * 22-Mar-2007 : Simplified getDataItem(RegularTimePeriod) - see patch 1685500 
 *               by Nick Guenther (DG);

The error message indicates that the `Second` and `Date` classes cannot be found, and that there is a mismatch between the expected `Double` type and the actual `double` type of the `value` variable. To fix the errors, the missing classes should be imported and the `value` variable should be of type `double`. Here is the updated test code:

```
