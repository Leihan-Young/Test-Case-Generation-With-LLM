```
The test code creates a `StatisticalCategoryDataset` with three data points and passes it to a `CategoryPlot` with a `StatisticalBarRenderer`. It then creates a `JFreeChart` object with the plot and creates a buffered image from the chart. The test checks that the image is not null.

```
The test code creates a `StatisticalCategoryDataset` with three data points and passes it to a `CategoryPlot` with a `StatisticalBarRenderer`. It then creates a `JFreeChart` object with the plot and creates a buffered image from the chart. The test checks that the image is not null.

The test code creates a `StatisticalCategoryDataset` with three data points and passes it to a `CategoryPlot` with a `StatisticalBarRenderer`. It then creates a `JFreeChart` object with the plot and creates a buffered image from the chart. The test checks that the image is not null.
