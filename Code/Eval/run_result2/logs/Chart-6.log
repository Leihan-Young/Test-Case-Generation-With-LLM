[assistant]:ShapeList() {

    list.setShape(0, rectangle);

Corrected test method:
```
public void testShapeList() {
    ShapeList list = new ShapeList();
    Rectangle2D rectangle = new Rectangle2D.Double(0, 0, 10, 10);
    list.setShape(0, rectangle);
    assertTrue(rectangle.equals(list.getShape(0)));
}

    list.setShape(0, rectangle);
    assertTrue(rectangle.equals(list.getShape(0)));
}
``` 

Explanation:
The error occurred because the `Rectangle2D` class was not imported. To fix the error, add the following import statement at the beginning of the test class:

```
import java.awt.geom.Rectangle2D;
``` 

Additionally, the last line of the test method should use `assertTrue` instead of `assertEquals` to compare two `Shape` objects, since `Shape` does not implement the `equals` method.
