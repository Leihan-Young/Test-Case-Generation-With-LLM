The test code creates a category dataset with four values and passes it to a MultiplePiePlot object. It sets a limit for aggregation and creates a JFreeChart object with the plot. Finally, it creates a chart panel and adds it to a frame for display. This test code can reveal a bug if there is an issue with the aggregation of the data in the pie chart.

The test code creates a category dataset with four values and passes it to a MultiplePiePlot object. It sets a limit for aggregation and creates a JFreeChart object with the plot. Finally, it creates a chart panel and adds it to a frame for display. This test code can reveal a bug if there is an issue with the aggregation of the data in the pie chart.

The test code creates a category dataset with four values and passes it to a MultiplePiePlot object. It sets a limit for aggregation and creates a JFreeChart object with the plot. Finally, it creates a chart panel and adds it to a frame for display. This test code can reveal a bug if there is an issue with the aggregation of the data in the pie chart.

```
The updated test code uses the `ChartFactory` class to create a `JFreeChart` object with the same properties as before. It also changes the `JFrame` import to `javax.swing.JFrame` and sets the default close operation to use `WindowConstants.EXIT_ON_CLOSE`. This should resolve the symbol errors and allow the test to run.
