 *               range (DG);
 * 14-Jun-2004 : Fixed bug in drawRangeMarker() method - now uses 'paint' and
 *               'stroke' rather than 'outlinePaint' and 'outlineStroke' (DG);
 * 15-Jun-2004 : Interval markers can now use GradientPaint (DG);
 * 30-Sep-2004 : Moved drawRotatedString() from RefineryUtilities

The test method creates a bar chart with the MinMaxCategoryRenderer as the renderer for the plot. It adds four values to the dataset for one series and four categories. It then creates a chart panel and adds it to a JFrame to display the chart.

The test method creates a bar chart with the MinMaxCategoryRenderer as the renderer for the plot. It adds four values to the dataset for one series and four categories. It then creates a chart panel and adds it to a JFrame to display the chart.

The test method creates a bar chart with the MinMaxCategoryRenderer as the renderer for the plot. It adds four values to the dataset for one series and four categories. It then creates a chart panel and adds it to a JFrame to display the chart.

The error message suggests that some of the required packages are not imported in the test class. To fix this error, the following import statements need to be added to the test class:

```
import javax.swing.JFrame;

import org.jfree.chart.ChartFactory;
import org.jfree.chart.ChartPanel;
import org.jfree.chart.JFreeChart;
import org.jfree.chart.plot.CategoryPlot;
import org.jfree.data.category.DefaultCategoryDataset;
```

Once these import statements are added, the test method should be able to build successfully.
