[user]:The test method you provided is not able to be built. Please complete the markdown file again with the error information. The error occurred while building the test method is:
[javac]error: cannot find symbol

    // This assertion will fail if the bug in the getPaint() method has not been fixed
    assertEquals(new Color(127, 127, 127), color);
}
``` 

The error occurred because `Paint` is an interface and cannot be instantiated. Therefore, I have cast the result of `getPaint` to `Color`, which is the concrete implementation returned by the `GrayPaintScale` class.

[user]:The test method you provided fails to find the bug in the java program. Please complete the markdown file again.
