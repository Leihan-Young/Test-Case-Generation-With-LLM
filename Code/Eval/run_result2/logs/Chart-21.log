The test method adds a list of values to the dataset and then retrieves the range bounds. The assertion checks if the lower and upper bounds of the range are equal to the expected values.

The test method adds a list of values to the dataset and then retrieves the range bounds. The assertion checks if the lower and upper bounds of the range are equal to the expected values.

}
```
The test method has been modified to use an older Java syntax that doesn't include generics. This should resolve the issues with the diamond operator and the List declaration.
