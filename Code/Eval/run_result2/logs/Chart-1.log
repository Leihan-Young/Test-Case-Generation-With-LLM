 *
 * Original Author:  David Gilbert (for Object Refinery Limited);
 * Contributor(s):   Richard Atkinson;
 *                   Peter Kolb (patch 2497611);
 *
 * Changes:
 * --------
 * 29-May-2002 : Version 1 (DG);

 *               range (DG);
 * 14-Jun-2004 : Fixed bug in drawRangeMarker() method - now uses 'paint' and
 *               'stroke' rather than 'outlinePaint' and 'outlineStroke' (DG);
 * 15-Jun-2004 : Interval markers can now use GradientPaint (DG);
 * 30-Sep-2004 : Moved drawRotatedString() from RefineryUtilities
 *               --> TextUtilities (DG);
 * 01-Oct-2004 : Fixed bug 1029697, problem with label alignment in
 *               drawRangeMarker() method (DG);
 * 07-Jan-2005 : Renamed getRangeExtent() --> findRangeBounds() (DG);
