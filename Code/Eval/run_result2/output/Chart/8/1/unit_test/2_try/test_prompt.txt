 * Changes
 * -------
 * 11-Oct-2001 : Version 1 (DG);
 * 18-Dec-2001 : Changed order of parameters in constructor (DG);
 * 19-Dec-2001 : Added a new constructor as suggested by Paul English (DG);
 * 29-Jan-2002 : Worked on the parseWeek() method (DG);
 * 13-Feb-2002 : Fixed bug in Week(Date) constructor (DG);
 * 26-Feb-2002 : Changed getStart(), getMiddle() and getEnd() methods to
 *               evaluate with reference to a particular time zone (DG);
 * 05-Apr-2002 : Reinstated this class to the JCommon library (DG);
 * 24-Jun-2002 : Removed unnecessary main method (DG);
 * 10-Sep-2002 : Added getSerialIndex() method (DG);
 * 06-Oct-2002 : Fixed errors reported by Checkstyle (DG);
 * 18-Oct-2002 : Changed to observe 52 or 53 weeks per year, consistent with
 *               GregorianCalendar. Thanks to Aimin Han for the code (DG);
 * 02-Jan-2003 : Removed debug code (DG);
 * 13-Mar-2003 : Moved to com.jrefinery.data.time package, and implemented
 *               Serializable (DG);
 * 21-Oct-2003 : Added hashCode() method (DG);
 * 24-May-2004 : Modified getFirstMillisecond() and getLastMillisecond() to
 *               take account of firstDayOfWeek setting in Java's Calendar
 *               class (DG);
 * 30-Sep-2004 : Replaced getTime().getTime() with getTimeInMillis() (DG);
 * 04-Nov-2004 : Reverted change of 30-Sep-2004, because it won't work for
 *               JDK 1.3 (DG);
 * ------------- JFREECHART 1.0.x ---------------------------------------------
 * 06-Mar-2006 : Fix for bug 1448828, incorrect calculation of week and year
 *               for the first few days of some years (DG);
 * 05-Oct-2006 : Updated API docs (DG);
 * 06-Oct-2006 : Refactored to cache first and last millisecond values (DG);
 * 09-Jan-2007 : Fixed bug in next() (DG);
 * 28-Aug-2007 : Added new constructor to avoid problem in creating new
 *               instances (DG);
 * 19-Dec-2007 : Fixed bug in deprecated constructor (DG);

# Test Code:
A test method that can reveal the bug of the java program.
```
public void test
[assistant]:Week() {
    Week week = new Week(new Date());
    assertEquals("Constructor 1: Week should be 52", 52, week.getWeek());
    assertEquals("Constructor 1: Year should be 2021", 2021, week.getYear().getYear());
}
```
The bug in the program is that the constructor used in the test method is not defined in the Week class. The Week class only has a constructor that takes in a year and week number, or a date and timezone. To fix the bug, the test method should use the appropriate constructor, like this:
```
public void testWeek() {
    Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();
    cal.set(Calendar.YEAR, 2021);
    cal.set(Calendar.MONTH, Calendar.DECEMBER);
    cal.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 31);
    Week week = new Week(cal.getTime());
    assertEquals("Week should be 53", 53, week.getWeek());
    assertEquals("Year should be 2021", 2021, week.getYear().getYear());
}
```
This test method sets the date to December 31, 2021, which falls in the 53rd week of the year. The test checks if the week and year returned by the Week object are correct.
[user]:The test method you provided fails to find the bug in the java program. Please complete the markdown file again.
