/**
 The whitelist based HTML cleaner. Use to ensure that end-user provided HTML contains only the elements and attributes
 that you are expecting; no junk, and no cross-site scripting attacks!
 <p/>
 The HTML cleaner parses the input as HTML and then runs it through a white-list, so the output HTML can only contain
 HTML that is allowed by the whitelist.
 <p/>
 It is assumed that the input HTML is a body fragment; the clean methods only pull from the source's body, and the
 canned white-lists only allow body contained tags.
 <p/>
 Rather than interacting directly with a Cleaner object, generally see the {@code clean} methods in {@link org.jsoup.Jsoup}.
