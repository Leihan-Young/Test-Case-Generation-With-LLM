/**
 * This class implements the common part of all embedded Runge-Kutta
 * integrators for Ordinary Differential Equations.
 *
 * <p>These methods are embedded explicit Runge-Kutta methods with two
 * sets of coefficients allowing to estimate the error, their Butcher
 * arrays are as follows :
 * <pre>
 *    0  |
 *   c2  | a21
 *   c3  | a31  a32
 *   ... |        ...
 *   cs  | as1  as2  ...  ass-1
 *       |--------------------------
 *       |  b1   b2  ...   bs-1  bs
 *       |  b'1  b'2 ...   b's-1 b's
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>In fact, we rather use the array defined by ej = bj - b'j to
 * compute directly the error rather than computing two estimates and
 * then comparing them.</p>
 *
 * <p>Some methods are qualified as <i>fsal</i> (first same as last)
 * methods. This means the last evaluation of the derivatives in one
 * step is the same as the first in the next step. Then, this
 * evaluation can be reused from one step to the next one and the cost
 * of such a method is really s-1 evaluations despite the method still
 * has s stages. This behaviour is true only for successful steps, if
 * the step is rejected after the error estimation phase, no
 * evaluation is saved. For an <i>fsal</i> method, we have cs = 1 and
 * asi = bi for all i.</p>
