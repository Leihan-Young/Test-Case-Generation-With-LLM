/**
 * DateTimeZone represents a time zone.
 * <p>
 * A time zone is a system of rules to convert time from one geographic 
 * location to another. For example, Paris, France is one hour ahead of
 * London, England. Thus when it is 10:00 in London, it is 11:00 in Paris.
 * <p>
 * All time zone rules are expressed, for historical reasons, relative to
 * Greenwich, London. Local time in Greenwich is referred to as Greenwich Mean
 * Time (GMT).  This is similar, but not precisely identical, to Universal 
 * Coordinated Time, or UTC. This library only uses the term UTC.
 * <p>
 * Using this system, America/Los_Angeles is expressed as UTC-08:00, or UTC-07:00
 * in the summer. The offset -08:00 indicates that America/Los_Angeles time is
 * obtained from UTC by adding -08:00, that is, by subtracting 8 hours.
 * <p>
 * The offset differs in the summer because of daylight saving time, or DST.
 * The following definitions of time are generally used:
 * <ul>
 * <li>UTC - The reference time.
 * <li>Standard Time - The local time without a daylight saving time offset.
 * For example, in Paris, standard time is UTC+01:00.
 * <li>Daylight Saving Time - The local time with a daylight saving time 
 * offset. This offset is typically one hour, but not always. It is typically
 * used in most countries away from the equator.  In Paris, daylight saving 
 * time is UTC+02:00.
 * <li>Wall Time - This is what a local clock on the wall reads. This will be
 * either Standard Time or Daylight Saving Time depending on the time of year
 * and whether the location uses Daylight Saving Time.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Unlike the Java TimeZone class, DateTimeZone is immutable. It also only
 * supports long format time zone ids. Thus EST and ECT are not accepted.
 * However, the factory that accepts a TimeZone will attempt to convert from
 * the old short id to a suitable long id.
 * <p>
 * DateTimeZone is thread-safe and immutable, and all subclasses must be as
 * well.

     * This method will return an offset suitable for calculating an instant

     * from 01:00 to 01:59:<br />

     * Input: 02:30  Output: 02:30<br />
     * <p>
     * During a DST overlap (where the local time is ambiguous) this method will return
     * the earlier instant. The combination of these two rules is to always favour
     * daylight (summer) time over standard (winter) time.
     * <p>
     * NOTE: Prior to v2.0, the DST overlap behaviour was not defined and varied by hemisphere.
     * Prior to v1.5, the DST gap behaviour was also not defined.
